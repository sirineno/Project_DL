# Investigating Human Visual Salience Prediction Using Pretrained ANNs and linear probing

Human attention is guided by both low-level visual features (e.g., contrast, edges) and high-level semantic information (e.g., faces, objects). Visual salience, which predicts where humans look first in an image, is a key topic in understanding human visual perception.

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the capability of pretrained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict human visual salience as measured by eye-tracking data. By examining the alignment between the networks' internal representations and human attention patterns, we aim to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying visual salience prediction.

### Objectives

- **Predict Human Visual Salience:** Investigate whether pretrained ANNs can accurately predict human visual salience using eye-tracking data.
- **Align Network Representations with Human Attention:** Examine the degree to which the internal representations of ANNs align with human attention patterns through linear probing techniques.
- **Understand Visual Perception:** Contribute to the broader understanding of human visual perception by analyzing the relationship between ANN predictions and human visual salience.

### Methodology

1. **Dataset:** Use SALICON dataset, which provides salience maps derived from crowd-sourced gaze data. We will not collect new data for this project, as the existing dataset provides sufficient coverage for our analysis. link : https://salicon.net
2. **Pretrained ANN Models:** Use the pretrained resnet50 to extract features of the images.
3. **Linear Probing:** Apply linear probing techniques to assess the alignment between the networks' extracted features and human saliency maps.
4. **Analysis:** Compare the model's predictions with the actual data to evaluate the performance of the models.


### Methods and Algorithms

1. **Pretrained Neural Networks:**
   - Use pretrained ResNet to extract image features. The model is known for capturing both low- and high-level visual information.
   
2. **Linear Probing:**
   - Apply linear probing to map the networkâ€™s features to the fixation data.
   - Train a simple linear model to predict human salience patterns using neural network representations as input.
   
3. **Salience Map Comparison:**
   - Generate salience maps from neural network predictions.
   - Compare these maps to the actual data to evaluate alignment.

### Evaluation

We will perform both qualitative and quantitative analyses to evaluate the results:

1. **Quantitative Metrics:**
   - Pearson Correlation: Assess correlation between ANN-predicted salience maps and human fixation maps.
   - AUC (Area Under the Curve): Evaluate how well network predictions match observed human fixations.
   
2. **Qualitative Analysis:**
    Visualize ANN-predicted salience maps and overlay them with human fixation heatmaps.
     
### Expected Outcomes

- Insights into the ability of pretrained ANNs to predict human visual salience.
- Understanding of the relationship between ANN internal representations and human attention patterns.
- Contribution to the field of visual perception and computational neuroscience.

### Conclusion

By investigating the predictive power of pretrained ANNs for human visual salience, this project aims to bridge the gap between artificial and human visual perception. The findings could have significant implications for the development of more human-like artificial vision systems and enhance our understanding of the neural basis of attention.
